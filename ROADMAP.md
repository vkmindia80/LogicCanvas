## 🧭 **Strategic Product Roadmap vs ProcessMaker (12–18 Months)**

This section looks beyond the current engineering phases (1–7) and positions **LogicCanvas** as a
**general-purpose BPM / workflow platform** that is:
- **Simpler** to configure and operate than ProcessMaker
- **More robust** in governance, security, and observability
- **More advanced** in AI-driven workflows and document automation

The plan is organized into four strategic phases. Timelines are indicative and can overlap.

---

### Phase A – Competitive Parity Core (0–3 Months)

**Goal:** Close remaining gaps with ProcessMaker’s core BPM platform (designer, case management,
RBAC, lifecycle, integrations) while keeping UX radically simpler.

**Themes:**
- **Simplicity:** Opinionated defaults, workflow templates, guided wizards
- **Robustness:** RBAC, lifecycle states, environments, auditability
- **Advanced:** First-class integration patterns and decisioning

**Key Initiatives:**
1. **BPMN-Minded Modeling Enhancements**
   - Add/extend BPMN-aligned elements (events, gateways, subprocesses, timers) where missing.
   - Provide **starter templates** for common approval flows (HR onboarding, invoice approval,
     purchase requests, contract approvals) so users rarely start from a blank canvas.
   - Introduce a **configuration wizard** for new workflows that walks users through:
     - Triggers (manual / schedule / webhook)
     - Assignment strategy
     - SLA targets
     - Notifications.

2. **RBAC, Tenants & Governance**
   - Implement a **role-based access control** model:
     - Roles: `platform_admin`, `workspace_admin`, `builder`, `approver`, `requester`, `viewer`.
     - Permissions per role for: modeling, publishing, executing, managing users, managing
       integrations.
   - Introduce **Workspaces / Tenants**:
     - Logical isolation of data (workflows, forms, instances, users) per workspace.
     - Workspace-level settings for branding, SLAs, and integrations.
   - Add **environment separation**:
     - Flags for `dev`, `test`, `prod` environments.
     - Promotion flow for moving a workflow definition from `dev` → `test` → `prod` with
       approvals.

3. **Lifecycle & Versioning UX**
   - Build a **workflow lifecycle panel**:
     - States: Draft → In Review → Published → Paused → Archived.
     - Audit trail of lifecycle changes and who performed them.
   - Upgrade existing versioning to a richer UI:
     - Side-by-side **version comparison** (node diff, property diff, form diff).
     - One-click **rollback** with justification comment.
   - Introduce **guardrails**:
     - Prevent destructive edits on published workflows (force new version creation).

4. **Integration Hub & APIs**
   - Design and publish a **public REST API spec** (OpenAPI) for:
     - Case creation, task completion, file uploads, query endpoints.
   - Create an **Integration Hub** section:
     - Prebuilt connectors for: Email (SMTP), Slack/Teams, generic REST, webhooks.
     - Centralized credential management with role-based access.
   - Simple **API key** management for automation/scripts and service accounts.

5. **Decision Tables & Business Rules (Parity with ProcessMaker Decisioning)**
   - Introduce **decision table** node(s):
     - Visual grid for rules (conditions → outcomes) with multiple hit policies.
     - Versioned tables, reusable across workflows.
   - Allow workflows to call decision tables as reusable **business rules**.

**Success Criteria (vs ProcessMaker):**
- A new customer can model, secure, and publish a production workflow 
  **faster and with fewer concepts** than in ProcessMaker.
- Admins can safely manage users, workspaces, and environments with clear audit trails.

---

### Phase B – Document Automation & IDP (3–6 Months)

**Goal:** Go beyond ProcessMaker IDP by deeply integrating document intelligence into workflows
without overwhelming configuration complexity.

**Themes:**
- **Simplicity:** No-code document pipelines and mappings
- **Robustness:** Compliance, retention, and traceability
- **Advanced:** AI-powered OCR, classification, extraction

**Key Initiatives:**
1. **Document-Centric Workflow Primitives**
   - Add **Document Intake** nodes:
     - Sources: direct upload, email inbox, SFTP/watch folder (via connector), API.
   - Attach **document bundles** to workflow instances (e.g., invoice + PO + contract).
   - Provide a **document timeline** for each case: when uploaded, viewed, approved, signed.

2. **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)**
   - Integrate OCR + layout-aware parsing for PDFs and images.
   - Provide configurable **document types** (Invoice, ID, Contract, KYC Package, etc.).
   - For each type, define **extraction schemas** (e.g., invoice number, total amount, tax).
   - Map extracted fields to **workflow variables** and form fields without custom code.

3. **Document Validation & Exception Handling**
   - Add **validation rules** on extracted data (e.g., totals match, mandatory fields present).
   - Route ambiguous/low-confidence extractions to a **human review queue**.
   - Provide review screens to compare original documents and extracted fields side by side.

4. **Compliance, Security & Retention**
   - Document-level **access controls** (who can view / download / redact).
   - **Retention policies** per document type (auto-archive / auto-delete after X time).
   - Redaction support and **PII tagging** for sensitive data.
   - End-to-end **document audit trail**.

**Success Criteria (vs ProcessMaker IDP):**
- A non-technical user can set up a full document-driven approval flow (e.g. invoice-to-pay) 
  in a single workspace, with extraction and approvals, **in under an hour**.
- Document review UX feels lighter and more intuitive than typical IDP products.

---

### Phase C – AI-First Workflow Platform (6–12 Months)

**Goal:** Make LogicCanvas feel like an **AI-native process platform**, not just a platform that
“added AI features”. Clearly surpass ProcessMaker’s AI Genies in guidance and optimization.

**Themes:**
- **Simplicity:** AI-guided design and configuration
- **Robustness:** Guardrails, explainability, and human override
- **Advanced:** Continuous optimization and intelligent routing

**Key Initiatives:**
1. **AI Co-Pilot for Designers**
   - "Describe your process in plain language" → generate a first-version workflow:
     - Nodes, assignments, SLAs, notifications.
   - AI suggestions inline in the canvas:
     - “You may want an approval step here.”
     - “Add SLA check between these two nodes.”
   - AI-assisted **form generation** from:
     - Example documents.
     - Text descriptions (“I need a vendor onboarding form with these fields…”).

2. **AI-Assisted Rules & Decisioning**
   - Allow AI to propose **decision tables** from historical data and business descriptions.
   - Natural language editor for rules:
     - “If invoice amount > 10k, require director approval” → formal rules/decision table.
   - Test and **simulate rules** with sample data and explainable outputs.

3. **AI in Runtime Execution**
   - AI-driven **routing recommendations**:
     - Suggest best approver based on workload, expertise, history.
   - Intelligent **exception handling**:
     - Suggest next best actions when tasks are blocked or SLA breaches are imminent.
   - **Classification and triage** nodes powered by AI (e.g., categorize requests, detect risk).

4. **Auto-Optimization & Insights**
   - Use historical analytics to recommend:
     - New SLAs or priority rules.
     - Parallelization opportunities to reduce cycle time.
   - “What-if” analysis:
     - Simulate impact of routing or SLA changes.

**Success Criteria (vs ProcessMaker AI):**
- Non-technical builders lean on AI suggestions for at least 50% of modeling tasks.
- The platform can propose **measurable improvements** (e.g., 20% cycle-time reduction) and
  simulate their effect before rollout.

---

### Phase D – Ecosystem, Extensibility & Enterprise (12+ Months)

**Goal:** Turn LogicCanvas from a standalone app into an extensible, enterprise-ready platform with
a rich ecosystem and strong governance.

**Themes:**
- **Simplicity:** Managed marketplace and guided configuration of extensions
- **Robustness:** Enterprise security, SSO, and compliance
- **Advanced:** Extensible runtime and cross-organization collaboration

**Key Initiatives:**
1. **Extension & Template Marketplace**
   - Pluggable **node types** (custom connectors, domain-specific actions).
   - Public **template library** for workflows, forms, and decision tables.
   - Support for private, workspace-specific catalogs.

2. **Enterprise-Grade Security & Governance**
   - SSO support (SAML / OpenID Connect) and SCIM for user provisioning.
   - IP allowlists, audit log exports, and fine-grained admin roles.
   - Data residency and regional deployment strategies.

3. **Environments, Change Management & Release Flow**
   - Formal **promotion workflows** for moving changes across environments:
     - Draft changes → review → approval → deployment.
   - Versioned **configuration snapshots** for rollback (workflows, forms, rules, integrations).

4. **Ecosystem & Partner Integrations**
   - Deep integrations with major SaaS (HR, Finance, CRM) via certified connectors.
   - Public **SDKs** / client libraries for common languages.

**Success Criteria:**

## ✅ Outcome KPIs vs ProcessMaker

To ensure LogicCanvas is not just feature-complete but **better** than ProcessMaker, track these
high-level KPIs:

1. **Simplicity & Adoption**
   - Median time for a new builder to publish a production-ready workflow from scratch.
   - % of new workflows started from **templates** or **AI co-pilot** vs blank canvas.
   - Onboarding completion rate and time-to-first-successful-run.

2. **Robustness & Reliability**
   - Uptime (target ≥ 99.9% for core API and UI).
   - Error rate per 1,000 workflow runs.
   - SLA breach rate across all tasks and workflows.
   - Mean time to recovery (MTTR) for failed executions.

3. **Advanced Intelligence & Automation**
   - % of document-driven workflows using **IDP/auto-extraction** end to end.
   - Average **cycle-time reduction** after AI optimization recommendations are applied.
   - % of builders actively using **AI co-pilot** and AI rule suggestions.

4. **Enterprise Readiness & Ecosystem**
   - Number of active workspaces/tenants per deployment.
   - Number of third-party **extensions/connectors** installed.
   - Share of users authenticating via SSO in enterprise accounts.

Tracking these KPIs alongside the phase-based roadmap will ensure LogicCanvas evolves into a
platform that is **simpler to adopt**, **more reliable to operate**, and **more intelligent** than
ProcessMaker for both internal approval workflows and broader BPM use cases.
