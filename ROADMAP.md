**Immediate Tasks:**
1. Create project structure
2. Setup backend with FastAPI
3. Setup frontend with React
4. Configure MongoDB connection
5. Install all dependencies

---

## 📝 **NOTES & DECISIONS**

- Using React Flow for canvas (more feature-rich than custom implementation)
- No localStorage - all state in React context for session persistence
- Real-time updates via polling (WebSocket can be added later)
- Mobile-responsive design for task/approval screens
- Color-coded node types for visual clarity
- Comprehensive validation at every layer
